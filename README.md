# IA-Predict-Student-Dropout

This project aims to predict student dropout and academic success using supervised machine learning techniques.
Using a dataset of 4,424 students and 36 features from “Early prediction of student’s performance in higher education: a case study”, the task involves classifying students into Dropout, Enrolled, or Graduate categories.

### The workflow includes:

Data preprocessing: encoding categorical features, removing outliers, feature selection (correlation, variance, chi-square test), and applying SMOTE for balancing.

### Models evaluated:

 - Decision Tree – interpretable baseline model.

 - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) – captures local data patterns.

 - Multilayer Perceptron (Neural Network) – models complex, non-linear relationships.

 - Support Vector Machine (SVM) – robust classifier for non-linear separations.

Tools used: Python, JupyterLab, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Each model was compared based on accuracy and F1-score to determine the most effective approach for early prediction of student outcomes.
